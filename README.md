Hello beginner bootcampers. Here is your first formal homework  assignment!


**I expect you to do this assignment individually. I will notice if you copy another students code.**  
To be 100% clear: If I notice you copying other students homework you will get an invoice for the course.  
Don't discuss the homework in slack

- Download the starter files
- Make a local git repo and use it to track your work
- When you're done add a remote and push to your github
- **Send the link to your repo to teachers@codaisseur.com before Saturday 20:00**

Expectations:
- I expect you give this homework assignment your best shot.
- You should be able to complete this homework without my help if there was no time limit.
- I expect you to spend 6-8 hours on this assignment. You can spend more but prioritize enough sleep, doing laundry etc.
- I expect people without experience to be able to implement most tests
- I expect some people with programming experience before this bootcamp to able to finish the whole assignment within the time-limit.

Tips:
- Use readest, stackoverflow and documentation
- Check the tests on the page for hints
- You get no points for Extra CSS that is not in the assignment (except the fuzzy feeling in your own brain)
- If you feel you had a bad result write a reflection on your way of working in the readme of your project

## Section 1. Creating the hero object

Follow the tests in the browser

## Section 2. Implementing the basic game logic and UI

**The functions you will be defining are already being called by the test file.** It will complain in the console if they are not working correctly yet.

**note:** You could implement this game logic in many other ways. But in order for the tests to guide you the instructions are very specific.

## Section 3. CSS

- Link an external stylesheet and make all the pictures the same size.

## Section 4 - Bonus: Show me what you got


- Write `displayStats` function that writes your hero's name, health, weapontype, weapon damage to the page. Call it at the end of your script

- Create a form that allow users to change the name of their hero.

- Call `displayStats` when some data of the hero has change to update the page.

- Implement fighting an enemy. (how you do it is up to you!)

- When an enemy or weapon gets clicked it gets deleted from the page




## I wasn't able to finish my project
I wanted to create a whole GUI around it, I hit some snags and it took me long to figure out.
Even created a SO question for it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51800635/variable-is-pushed-but-it-doesnt-exist-later

It delayed the time I had to implement the fighting system, with enemy's updating their status as well
And I wasn't able to finish the main Scenario loop, but you can very easily add new Scenes with the use of a simple API.

They were supposed call actions, such as fighting scenes.

Because of this, "I expect you give this homework assignment your best shot" I wanted to learn something new in the process as well.
Such as canvas editing as this is a new experience for me to work with sprites.

But without the use of library's it takes very long to get it right, because this was about knowing how to write JS without the use of external lirbary's.
